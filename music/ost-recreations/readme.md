These files represent my attempts to recreate original Game Boy music using various trackers designed for creating Game Boy music. The reason for recreating originals was to learn about the techniques used to create music on the Game Boy (and retro game music in general)

Depending on the song the process might vary, but in general it involves a combination of: [GBSimport](https://github.com/chiptunecafe/GBS-Import), [Dn-Famitracker](https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker), waveform analysis in [Audacity](), and just plain old listening by ear.
